Internago’s services are not restricted to the private sector. In recent decades internationalization has risen to prominence in higher education institutions. Internationalization enables universities to adjust curricula to international standards, and to develop partnership with foreign universities thus offering national students’ greater competencies and opportunities, as well as resulting in being more attractive to foreign students.


Internago is proud to work with a Nordic university for setting up their local administration in France, including the establishment of a representation office and their bank account set up. The online process and ability to control and access documents from the HQ were important factors in choosing Internago.
