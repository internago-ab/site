## Internago Business Advisory Services recently performed an establishment analysis for a large food retail chain. 

The objective was to quickly get information regarding payroll and labour laws with focus on a **cost / risk analysis of the employment** of a large number of people in three different countries; Portugal, Chile and Italy.
Key questions covered:

* Minimum Wages by categories (workers / managers)
* Maximum hours per week, restrictions, breaks, hours per day
* Holidays by categories
* Format of layoffs and costs
* Approximate costs associated with different contracts and categories
* Other important factors that affect the running costs

If you are planning to enter a new market, and need a quick guide to understand the establishment costs, please contact Internago Advisory by sending an email to [info@internago.com](mailto:info@internago.com).
