Our customer is a large Spanish restaurant chain, which is in international expansion phase.




They are evaluating setting up restaurants in France and Italy and are interested in the cost, rules and regulations for setting up their business. The restaurant sector is a particular regulated business sector in most countries.




We are happy to provide them with pre-studies in France and Italy regarding cost, procedure and administration for employment, payroll, and the integration with local partners (bank, accounting firm and lawyer).




Are you also interested in knowing the costs and preconditions for international expansion? Please contact us on [info@internago.com](mailto:info@internago.com).
