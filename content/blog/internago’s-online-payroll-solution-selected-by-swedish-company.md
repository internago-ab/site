A Swedish machine production company has chosen Internago’s online payroll solution for its subsidiary and employees in France. The reason behind the migration to a digital platform was driven by the need to improve the quality demands set up by the HQ, and to handle personal data in line with the new GDPR regulations.

–”*We are seeing an increasing demand from companies, especially SME’s with many international subsidiaries to consolidate and digitalize the processing of their payroll. With our single digital interface it’s simple to integrate also already existing payroll providers and software from all markets into our platform*”

Robert Wentrup, CEO Internago
