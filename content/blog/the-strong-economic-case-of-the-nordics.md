## This is how fun you have when you get to talk about the Nordics and their economies!


Last week we held a joint seminar at **Chambre de Commerce Suédoise en France – CCSF** in Paris with **Nordic Equities** – a Swedish independent asset management company. During the seminar we highlighted the unique and strong economic position of the Nordic region. The stock markets’ track records have outperformed the rest of Europe for many years. 

The Nordic countries are small, rich and flexible; they have a dedicated green focus driving innovation forward, and they are benefitting from early technological adaptation with Internet penetration rates way above other economic regions.
