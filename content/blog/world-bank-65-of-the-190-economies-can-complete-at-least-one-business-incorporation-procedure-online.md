World Bank 2018 report says “5 of the 190 economies covered by Doing Business, entrepreneurs can complete at least one business incorporation procedure online, compared with only nine of the 145 economies measured in Doing Business 2004”


We at Internago will work to ensure that this figure will be much higher in just a few years.  Reducing and facilitating administration for companies is our mission.
