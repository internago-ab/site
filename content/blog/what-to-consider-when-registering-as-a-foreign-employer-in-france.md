Are you navigating the question of how to enter the French market? Have you read our previous blog about [registering as a Foreign employer vs. creating a Legal entity](https://www.internago.com/key-considerations-when-choosing-between-establishing-a-legal-entity-or-registering-as-a-foreign-employer-in-a-new-market/)? If you have decided that the foreign employer arrangement is your strategy of choice, there are several considerations to ensure compliance with French laws and regulations. Below, you will find a brief overview and some key aspects to take into account.

**R﻿egistering at relevant social security and employment related authorities**

R﻿egistering as a foreign employer can be a good and cost-efficient solution for entering a market, especially if you are only hiring one or a few employees and do not plan to invoice your customers from the local market. As a foreign employer in France, you must ensure compliance with French social security regulations by registering with the relevant social security authorities. This includes URSSAF (French Social Security) and contributions for healthcare, pensions, unemployment insurance, and other social benefits for employees. 

**E﻿mployment Contracts and Documentation, and Labour Laws**

T﻿he French labour laws are strictly regulated, and compliance with them is crucial when hiring employees in France. This includes drafting employment contracts in accordance with French labour standards and language requirements, adhearing to working hour regulations, and ensuring compliance with minimum wage requirements. Furthermore, contracts need to outline job responsibilities, compensation packages, benefits, and other terms of employments. 

**P﻿ermits and Visas**

I﻿f you plan to hire non-EU/EEA nationals, you are obliged to secure work permits and visas. Do yourself a favour and start by obtaining the necessary permits and visas for your employees to legally work in France.  Particular attention should also be given to the employees` tax situation to ensure they are correctly taxed. 

**L﻿anguage and Cultural Considerations**

C﻿onsidering language and cultural differences is wise when operating in France. French is the official language of business and administration, so proficiency in French or working with local translators and advisors may be necessary for effective communication and compliance. 

**L﻿egal and Regulatory Compliance**

S﻿taying informed about changes in French laws and regulations is equally important. Monitoring updates from regulatory authorities and seeking legal advice will help ensure ongoing compliance with French legal requirements, keeping you on top of this issue. 

B﻿y addressing these considerations and seeking professional advice as needed, you can navigate the process of registering as a foreign employer in France and establish a compliant and successful presence.
