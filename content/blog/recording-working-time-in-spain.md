When operating payroll in Spain, it is essential to record employees' attendance and time worked to comply with Spanish labour laws and regulations, particularly regarding the maximum number of working hours, rest periods, and overtime.

Employers are legally required to keep track of the daily working hours of their employees, including start and end times, breaks taken, and any overtime worked. This information must be kept on file for a minimum of four years.

The purpose of registering working time is to protect the rights of employees, to prevent exploitation by employers, and ensure a safe working environment. By tracking working hours, employers can ensure employees are not working more than the maximum number of hours permitted by law, and that they receive the appropriate rest periods and breaks.

Suffice to say, keeping accurate records enables employers to calculate and pay employees' wages and benefits correctly, including any overtime pay or additional compensation for working outside regular hours.

**Which law regulates this?**

The European Union’s [Working Time Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=706&langId=en&intPageId=205) regulates the working hours of employees in Europe. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in 2019 that all member states must require employers to record the daily working time of their employees, and to ensure compliance with maximum weekly working hours and minimum rest periods. This ruling was made in response to a case brought by a Spanish trade union, which argued that Spanish law did not require employers to record employees' daily working times.

Following this ruling, the Spanish government introduced the Royal Decree-Law 8/2019 in March of that year, which amended the Spanish Workers' Statute (Estatuto de los Trabajadores) and required companies to record the hours worked for each employee daily and to be compliant with the maximum working day, overtime hours, and rest periods. The law also set out the procedures for record-keeping as well as penalties for employers who failed to comply.

**How to record time worked?**

There are various tools and methods available for companies to record working time in Spain. Some examples:

* Time clocks
* [Web-based](https://www.internago.com/payroll) or mobile apps  
* Biometric systems
* Computer-based systems that can track working hours automatically based on logging in and out of a computer.

Data collected must be kept confidential and secure, and employers must inform employees of the purpose of collecting data and how this data will be used.

**Key considerations when employing personnel in Spain.**

To sum up, when employing personnel in Spain, either through a local subsidiary or as a [foreign employer](https://www.internago.com/register-as-foreign-employer), you need to ensure you are compliant with local rules and regulations.

Make sure to record time accurately for all employees, including remote workers.

**Record working hours, overtime, and breaks.**

Store data for four years in case of an audit.

Select a suitable solution for recording time worked (on-line, app etc.)

Failure to comply fully can result in a fine of up to €6250.
