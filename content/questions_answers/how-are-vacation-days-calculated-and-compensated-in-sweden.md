Employees in Sweden are entitled to 25 days of paid vacation annually, though some collective agreements offer more. Vacation pay is usually calculated as a percentage of the employee's salary, typically 12%. If an employee does not take all their vacation days, they may be entitled to a vacation pay supplement.
