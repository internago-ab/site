In Sweden, employees are entitled to sick pay if they cannot work due to illness. The first day is a waiting day without pay. From the second day and onwards, the employer pays sick pay for up to 14 days. After that, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency takes over the compensation, but at a slightly lower rate. There are specific rules and ceilings for the amounts and duration of sick pay.
