Each employee acquires 2.5 working days days of paid leave for each month of
actual work done

in the company. The total duration of the leave may not exceed 30 working days per year.

If the number of days of paid leave is not is not a whole number, it is rounded up to the higher number.

# For example: an employee having worked 3 months during the year will have 8 days of paid leave (3 x 2.5 = 7.5).
