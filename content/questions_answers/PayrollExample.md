description: >-
  The organization of paid leave is the responsibility of the employer's power
  of direction. The employer has the possibility of imposing paid vacations to
  the employee.



  The employee must necessarily take his/her days off during a specific day of leave during a specific period, normally the countryâ€™s normal holiday season. 



  In principle, this period is fixed by a company agreement or, by a default collective bargain agreement. 

  The legal period adjusting the vacation balances in France is between May 1 to October 31.
