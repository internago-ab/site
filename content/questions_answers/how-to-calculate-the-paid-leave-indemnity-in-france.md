During the paid leave period, the employer must pay the employee a leave
indemnity.

This indemnity can be calculated according to two different methods:

1. ”Maintenance” method - the salary maintenance method: the indemnity is equal to the amount of remuneration that would have been received during the period of leave if the employee had continued to work;

2. The “1/10 method”: the indemnity is equal to one tenth of the total gross remuneration received by the employee during the reference period.

## The employer must compare these two methods of calculation and choose the most advantageous amount for the employee.
