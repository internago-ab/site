Terminating an employee in Sweden is highly regulated to protect workers' rights. Employers must have objective grounds for termination, such as redundancy or misconduct. In most cases, employers are required to give notice. The notice period can vary depending on the employee's length of service and the terms of their contract or collective agreement.
