  Short anwswer is yes. In the absence of a collective agreement or convention
  it is the employer who defines the dates of the paid leave. The employee is
  not free to determine the dates of his or her leave. 

  The employee must make a request to the employer the employer. The latter may refuse.

  In this case, the paid leave must be taken on another date.
