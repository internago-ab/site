## Employing in United Kingdom

<div class='half-text'>

<div class='half'>

<div>

In order to register in the UK as an overseas company, registration is done at the so called Companies House, but this is only if you intend to have a base in the UK. The UK office of an foreign company, can either be established as a branch or as a subsidiary.
<br><br>
Once you employ a person in the UK, you’re obliged to provide an employer’s liability insurance, and companies who don’t will be fined on a continuous daily basis. Additionally, if the employee needs a work permit to work in the UK, a so called Employer Sponsorship Licence will be needed.
Employers must also register with HM Revenue and Customs before the first payday. This process usually takes up to five days. This will yield your employer Pay As You Earn (PAYE) number which is your main reference with regards to tax payments in the UK.
<br><br>
Employees have a range of rights in the UK, which varies according to status, from a full employee to an agent or contractor. In general, employment regulations and rights are identical in England and Wales, whereas Scotland and Northern Ireland can differ on certain points. Always make sure you are up-to-date with the right regulatory framework.
<br><br>
Employment contracts don’t necessarily have to be written, although it is highly recommended. If written, a contract must detail: job title / description; location; pay; benefits; hours; holiday; notice period; training entitlements / requirements. Employees must also receive clear information where to access information regarding disciplinary and grievance procedures, as well as pension schemes, and sick pay.

National Insurance contributions (NIC) in the UK are divided based on employee categories. Each letter stands for a separate category. The most common is category A, and is the one which rates are listed for in the below sections. A: Employees not falling into any of the below categories. B: Married women/widows entitled to pay reduced NIC. C: Employees of State pension age. J: Employees who can defer NIC due to it being deducted from another job. H: An apprentice under the age of 25 years old. M: Employees under the age of 21 years old. Z: Employees under the age of 21 years old, who can defer NIC due to it being deducted from another job.
<br><br>
Furthermore, employer payroll contributions are split into a threshold system, stipulating limits based on monthly payroll: 520 GBP for the Lower Earnings Limit (LEL), 797 GBP for the Primary Threshold (PT), 737 GBP for the Secondary Threshold (ST) and finally 4,189 GBP for the Upper Earnings Limit (UEL), the Upper Secondary Threshold (UST) and the Apprentice Upper Secondary Threshold (AUST).
<br><br>
Generally, in the UK, employees cannot work more than an average of 48 hours per week, calculated over a 17-week period. For employees aged 18 or younger different rules apply.
