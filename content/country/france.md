## Employing in France

Employment law in France is not contained under a single law. Instead it is governed by statutory regulations codified in (among other laws) the French labour code, the French Constitution as well as European Commission and other international labour conventions. Furthermore, collective labour law through codetermination, trade unions and collective bargaining plays a significant role in French labour relations.s

French employment law provides strong labor conditions and protections for employees, so employing people will be an important investment and commitment.

Temporary agencies are popular options for more flexible workforce arrangements. For these and many other reasons, the following are only guidelines in the broadest sense, and professional legal services are recommended when employing in France.
