## Employing in France

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

When hiring in France it is customary, but not obligatory, to register a local company, or a branch of an international company, when employing in France. A foreign employer not registering a local company is known as a SEF (“sans établissement en France”). Regardless of legal form the employer is obliged to contact the managing authority for French social security known as URSSAF (Union de recouvrement des cotisations de Sécurité sociale et d'allocations familiales). This is to ensure alignment with mandatory health insurance, retirement pensions and family allowances for employees. It is also obligatory to register with a pension organization, depending on the field of business activity.

<br>

Before the hiring takes place, minimum 48 hours in advance the company must complete a so-called DPAE (Déclaration Préalable à l’Embauche) which allows the employer to administer all formal activities in one go. It is found and submitted on the URSSAF website. The following components are necessary: copy of employee ID (and residence permit if not a Schengen area citizen), social security certificate, medical examination (obligatory for everyone and includes the employer’s registration with a local occupational health center ("centre de médecine du travail”).

<div class='half second-half'>

Indefinite contracts are not obligatory, but by far the most common in France. The contract must specify:
<br>

- <p>the number of hours of work (legal working-time is 35 hours a week, or 151.67 hours per month, and hours beyond that are by law considered paid overtime, and specified in collective bargaining agreements).</p>
- <p>Any probationary periods</p>
- <p>Name of position occupied</p>
- <p>Classification and remuneration details</p>

<br>

If it is a fixed-term contracts (CDD) or a part-time contract, it must be in writing.
<br><br>
It is mandatory for the employer to subscribe to a health insurance (“mutuelle”) for all employees, which can either be provided by an insurance company or a pension organization. However, fixed-term employees (CDD) employed shorter than 12 months are not included. Depending on the employer’s business activity, it may also be mandatory to subscribe to a private accident and invalidity insurance (“Prévoyance”).
<br><br>
Cases of sick-leave and parental leave are partly paid by social security and depending on collective agreements the employer may have to pay an additional supplement.
