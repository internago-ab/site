## Employing in Germany

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

To enable running a local payroll in Germany companies must register the new business with the local municipality’s authorities. These include:

- <p>Local Trade Office (Gewerbeamt)</p>
- <p>Trade Register (Handelsregister)</p>
- <p>Local Tax Office (Finanzamt)</p>
- <p>Relevant Professional Chamber</p>
- <p>Employer's Liability Insurance Association (Berufsgenossenschaft)</p>

<br>

Although registration with the Trade Office automatically leads to the Tax Office, Trade Register and Employer's Liability Insurance Association being informed, it is generally recommended to follow up on this as a company too, to ensure registrations are complete.

<br>

A local tax number (Steuernummer) is issued to the company once registered with the Tax Office. Similarly, a registration in the relevant Employer’s Liability Insurance Association leads to the company acquiring a membership number (Unfallversicherungsnummer) once its first employee is hired. It is also obligatory to register for an operation number (Betriebsnummer) at the job agency (Agentur für Arbeit).

<br>

These three (Steuernummer, Unfallversicherungsnummer and Betriebsnummer) are all required for correct communication and payments with respect to the company’s social security obligations.

</div>
</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

Trade union (Gewerkschaft) membership is constitutionally protected in Germany and collective agreement are in most cases obligatory.
<br>
German employees must, by law, be given a written employment contract that mentions key components of the employment relationship. This includes:

- <p>Parties to the contract</p>
- <p>The employee’s work tasks</p>
- <p>Gross salary and benefits</p>
- <p>Annual leave</p>
- <p>Entitlement</p>
- <p>Start date of employment</p>
- <p>Working location</p>
- <p>Notice periods</p>

<br>

Usually, terms and conditions based on Collective Bargaining Agreements’ frameworks are also included.

<br><br>
The employer must register all new employees for social insurance. Such registration, (with a health insurance company) has to be completed within six weeks of the employee being hired.
<br><br>
Employers are also responsible, on behalf of the employee, for the continued collection of a so called “capital formation savings payment” (Vermögenswirksame Leistungen), which should be run through the payroll. The employee chooses what insurer he/she wants to use for this.
<br><br>
New employees must also be registered with Germany’s Electronic Payroll Tax Deduction Characteristics (known as ELStAM) before the first payroll is run.
