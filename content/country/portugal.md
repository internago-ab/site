## Employing in Portugal

<div class=' half-text'>

<div class='half'>

<div>

Much of the EU’s legal system with regards to employment is similarly applied in Portugal. Also its directives regulating labour relations originate in the EU and are thus very similar to many EU neighbours. When it comes to the regulatory landscape surrounding collective labour, Portugal also uses collective employment contracts. Foreigners employed in Portugal have strong legal protection, and are on equal terms with local portuguese employees.

</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

There is no law that states that employment contracts have to be in written, except for when it comes to foreign employees or contracts that are only part-time or fixed term. Portuguese is widely required, among public authorities,as the language that the local paperwork is done in, and so it is recommended to use this locally. It is often the case that a range of obligatory statutory provisions are included in an employment contract, guided by collective bargaining agreements and the Portuguese Employment Code. The following components are obligatory in an employment contract:

- Full identity of employer
- Working periods
- Applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements
- Notice period for termination
- Date of employment
- Place of work
- Employee’s professional category
- Description of activities performed
- Vacation duration
- Salary amount
