## Employing in Netherlands

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

Dutch social security is comprised of a variety of different schemes. These can be divided into 3 groups: National insurances, social security, and voluntary insurances. The first are paid as part of wage taxes, the second are paid to the tax office and the monthly tax report details this on individual employee level. The tax office shares such information with the social security office, UWV (Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen).

<br>

The Netherlands’ system of social security includes a National Insurance scheme which covers old age, death, long-term invalidity, a selection of medical expenses and child benefits. Employees are also insured against illness, long-term invalidity and unemployment.

<br>

National insurance is compulsory for everyone who works or resides permanently in the Netherlands. The schemes are:

<br>

- <p>General Child Benefit Act (Algemene Kinderbijslagwet, AKW)</p>
- <p>National Survivor Benefits Act (Algemene nabestaandenwet, ANW)</p>
- <p>General Old Age Pensions Act (Algemene Ouderdomswet, AOW)</p>
- <p>Long-term Care Act (Wet langdurige zorg, WLZ)</p>

<br>

</div>
</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

Social security costs are to be fully paid by the employer. For unemployment the premium is 2.7% premium for permanent employees and 7.7% for fixed-term / flexible employees. 7.53% covers the long term disability insurance. Depending on what business area the employer operates in a premium is also to be paid for a short term disability insurance. A typical rate is 0.91% Finally, employers contribute to healthcare with 7%.

<br>

The above is based on employees’ annual taxable income up to € 58.311.

<br>

Employment law in the Netherlands is statutory legislation which is codified in the Dutch Civil Code. It is also governed by other things such as collective labour agreements, internal regulations and the individual employment contract itself.

<br>

Childcare in the Netherlands is very expensive and as a consequence of this, a lot of people work part-time jobs. Employers must allow part-time work or work flexible hours. The only way the employer can turn down such a request is if there are strong and objective reasons not to.
