## Employing in Spain

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

In preparation of becoming an employer a local company has to be formed. Procedures to achieve this in Spain are generally similar to other EU countries. However, Spain obligates companies to establish so-called equality plans in Spain if their number of employees exceeds 100. Starting on 7 March 2022, the same will apply for companies with more than 50 employees. Such equality plans have certain obligatory contents, including aspects of quantification, and training, as well as continuous follow-up and review of these plans.

<br>

Spanish workdays are notoriously different from the rest of Europe, due to the siesta tradition, which means that workers and school children go home for some three hours in the middle of the day, usually between 14.00 to 16.00 or sometimes to 17.00. Following the pandemic, and the overall decentralization and digitization of labour where many workers are working from home, a trend has started to be seen where de facto work hours more and more are similar to the standard European 08.00-17.00. The standard work week in Spain is 40 hours.

</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

In addition, and with reference to the above working hours, the law still dictates that a minimum of 12 hours rest is needed between workdays and the employee can work no more than 80 overtime hours per year.

<br>

First paragraph explaining the status of employment law, e.g. statutory legislation, collective labour agreements, the influence of collective bargaining agreements vs written legislation. Other unique or unusual labour market aspect / characteristic can also be mentioned.

<br>

Second paragraph is about the overall strength of job security and what it means from an employer perspective. Mention what the most common forms of employment / workforce arrangement are (I.e. what legal setup).
