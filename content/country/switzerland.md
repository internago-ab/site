## Employing in Switzerland

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

<strong>It is customary, but not obligatory to register a legal entity in order to employ people in Switzerland. </strong><br></br>When hiring takes place, the employee’s details should be reported to the Social Security authorities known as AHV (“Ausgleichkasse”). This will yield a specific registration number that is used on all official correspondence.

<br>

If a foreign employer chooses to not establish a legal entity in Switzerland, up to 2-5 employees can be hired and will then be referred to as ANO-BAG workers (Arbeitnehmer mit Arbeitgeber ohne Beitragspflicht), which edtails that these employees are working for a non-contributory employer. It will then be the employee who is registered with the authorities and who makes both the employee’s and employer’s contributions for social security and tax.

<br>

Employment in Switzerland is regulated by the federal constitutions and law as well as cantonal law and case law. A number of collective agreements relating to the so called “Obligationsrecht (the code of obligations) are legally binding. An employment contract can make different arrangements in cases where no binding collective agreement applies.

</div>
</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

Working hours have a legal limit between 45 - 50 hours per week, depending on sector, and should be mentioned in the employment contract (Arbeitsvertrag / contrat de travail). Although the common work week is 40 hours. Work hours should usually be mentioned in the employment contract. Overtime work is termed Überstunden and must be compensated with a 25% salary premium, or with time off corresponding to the same duration as the overtime hours. For all night or shift work, authorisation is necessary from the cantonal authorities. Work on Sundays or on public holidays is banned, but exemptions can be requested. It is not uncommon that employers in Switzerland offer their staff to work flexible hours (Gleitzeit - horaire flexible).

<br>

Employers are also legally bound to provide a Pension Fund for every employee aged above 25 and has an annual income over CHF 21 510. Equally, employers have to arrange a Pension Fund for all employees over the age of 18 years, this fund is rather focussed on risk mitigation with regards to invalidity/death. Such fund contributions have to be at least divided equally between the employee and the employer. Pension contributions vary according to the employee’s age and are usually at 20- 25% of the salary for employees aged 40 or older.

| <h3>Employer</h3> | <p>Corporate income tax rate <strong>: Due to the federal system, with cantons setting their own tax rates on top of the federal corporate tax, the rates vary from canton to canton. The corporate tax rate therefore ranges between 11.9% and 21.6%. The choice of what canton to establish in therefore heavily influences tax costs.</strong></p> |
