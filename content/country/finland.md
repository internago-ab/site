## Employing in Finland

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

Employing in Finland comes with a variety of rights and obligations for the employer. The employer's obligations are in general about maintaining a healthy workplace environment, equality and the general well-being of the employee. These are informed through collective agreements and legislation.

<br>

When dealing with Finnish authorities, in certain instances official documents must be written in one of Finland’s official languages (Finnish or Swedish).
<br><br>

If an employee does not have a written contract (which is not obligatory, although customary), the employer must still describe in writing his/her employment terms. This writing must include:

- <p>Main work duties</p>
- <p>Duration of contract if fixed-term</p>
- <p>Probationary period (if applicable)</p>
- <p>What collective agreement applies</p>
- <p>Salary and pay terms</p>
- <p>Working hours and holidays</p>
- <p>Notice period</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

The employer must provide statutory insurance for its employees and pay for such insurances. (This includes employment pension insurance, accident insurance, group life insurance, unemployment insurance contribution, and social insurance premium.)
<br><br>
The employer must also provide an “annual wage slip” which details the sum of salary paid over the year as well as related taxes. In addition to this the employer must also inform the tax administration about their payroll on a monthly and annual basis. Finally employers must pay for employees occupational healthcare.

| <h3>Salary payouts</h3> | <p>Finland has a monthly payroll frequency, usually paid on the last day of each month. There is also a 13th month salary payout, which is usually paid out before the employee’s holiday. <br><br>A standard workweek in Finland is 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week. All working hours that exceed this number are to be paid as overtime and are regulated by the employment contract/collective agreements. It must also be mutually agreed upon before the commencement of any overtime working hours. 138 overtime hours over a four month period (and 250 hours annually) is usually the maximum limit. The first two hours are usually paid at 150% of the regular salary rate and 200% for subsequent hours. Overtime work on weekends/sundays/rest days are paid at 200%. |
