## Employing in Italy

<div class=' half-text'>
<div class='half'>

<div>

In order to pay out salaries in Italy, it is generally necessary to register a local company.

<br>

24 hours prior to the start of a new employment, the employer has to notify the public employment service (Centro per l’Impiego). As such, social security institutions INPS and INAIL are notified in accordance with the law.

<br>

Various collective labour agreements (CCNL) dictate the employer’s obligations. These agreements affect weekly work hours, minimum wages, probation periods and more. As such, it is wise to define a new employment contract together with a professional as it can have an important impact on your business.

</div>
</div>

<div class='half second-half'>

Italy’s standard working hours are 8 hours per day (40 hours per week). Any additional work time spent by an employee has to be paid as overtime, which is further defined depending on the employment contract as well as the applied collective agreements.
